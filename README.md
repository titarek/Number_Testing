# 📝 Number Testing (Bash Script)

This repository contains a practice Bash script created as part of my coursework.  
The script takes a number from the user and provides a menu with options to perform different operations.

---

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Bash script that:
- Takes a number as input
- Displays a menu using `case`
- Performs operations using functions:
  1. Check if the number is Prime
  2. Check if the number is a Leap Year
  3. Print the Sum of Series (1 to n)
  4. Exit

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm
1. Start
2. Read a number from the user
3. Show menu with options
4. Use `case` to select the operation
5. Call the respective function:
   - `check_prime()` → checks prime
   - `check_leap_year()` → checks leap year
   - `sum_series()` → prints sum of series
6. Repeat until user chooses Exit
7. End
